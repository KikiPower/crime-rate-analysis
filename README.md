## Objective: 
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify the predictors of serious crimes using Bayesian regression techniques.
## Data Analysis:
- Performed exploratory data analysis on variables such as total population, poverty levels, unemployment rates, and income.
- Visualized patterns using pairs plots and correlation matrices to determine significant predictors.
## Methodology:
- Utilized Bayesian regression, Monte Carlo simulations, and Gibbs sampling to estimate posterior distributions of regression coefficients.
- Implemented models to assess the relationship between poverty levels, capita income, and crime rates.
- Conducted diagnostic checks including trace plots, autocorrelation plots, and ergodic mean plots to ensure model reliability.
## Results:
- Determined significant predictors of crime rates with high confidence intervals and credible intervals.
- Demonstrated robust model fitting and parameter stability across different statistical approaches.
- Tools and Technologies: R, Bayesian Regression, Monte Carlo Simulations, Gibbs Sampling, Data Visualization (R plots and ggplot2), Statistical Analysis
